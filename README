String Calculator Kata

In the esercizio.php file you can find the development of all six steps.
I developed the kata using PHP language. 

Once you have copied the file into your root directory, you can launch the function form the file itself. 
In order to demonstrate that i had worked incrementally, I started working on the following step copying the previuos function and 
changing it. For this reason you will find six version of the add() module, in particular the first one will satisfy the requirements 
of the first step,the second one the requirements of the second step and so on.

Each version is named as: add_sepN()
where N represents the number of the step on which it is referred to (1,2,3,4,5).
The last step (i.e. step six) represents the final result. I decided to define this function exactly add().

After each step, you will find the echo of the resulting string. To change the input string you can just edit this part and you 
will see the result on your browser.
